Hi 
This sketch, program is to make the electronics for a crossing of a model rail road. 
When finished it will have 4 different lichting patterns, two servo to close the booms and 2 sensors to sense passing trains. 
Feel free to use. I made a special PCB for it send me an email if you you want to receive the plans or (complete)product.
